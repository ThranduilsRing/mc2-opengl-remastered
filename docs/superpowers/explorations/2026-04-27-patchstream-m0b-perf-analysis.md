# PatchStream M0b — §11 Perf Analysis & Closeout

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Branch:** `claude/nifty-mendeleev`
**Tip commit:** `9cf3d4f` (after M0b implementation tasks 0–7 and runner fixes)
**Hardware:** AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, driver 26.3.1.260309
**Build:** RelWithDebInfo, mc2.exe md5 `805d4bb8bb2ad0bd4cc37dcf48410e88`

## TL;DR

**M0b is functionally complete but does not meet spec §11's perf threshold.** Modern path is correct, default-off, and ships zero behavior change at killswitch=0. At killswitch=1 mc2_01–mc2_24 tier1 runs cleanly with zero GL errors and zero overflow, but FPS regresses by an average of **-26%** (worst case mc2_10 at **-52%**). Root cause: bucket count at the raw `terrainHandle` level (24–206 per frame) is 4–15× higher than the legacy path's post-canonicalization draw count (5–15 nodes), so the modern path issues many small draws where the legacy path issues few fat ones. Spec §11 perf criterion 1 fails.

## Verification results (corrected — earlier numbers used stale v0.1.1 binary)

### tier1 killswitch=0 (legacy parity baseline)

| Mission | FPS | p1% | Frames | Δ destroys | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| mc2_01 | 142 | 116 | 4253 | 0 | PASS |
| mc2_03 | 136 | 111 | 4062 | 0 | PASS |
| mc2_10 | 127 | 84  | 3804 | 0 | PASS |
| mc2_17 | 124 | 74  | 3710 | 0 | PASS |
| mc2_24 | 143 | 112 | 4285 | 0 | PASS |

Pre-PR baseline FPS was within ±1 of these numbers — legacy parity is bit-identical-equivalent. Task 8 ✅.

### tier1 killswitch=1 (modern path active, 30s each)

| Mission | FPS | Δ vs ks=0 | p1% | Frames | Buckets seen | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| mc2_01 | 100 | -30% | 54 | 2988 | 44–109 | PASS |
| mc2_03 | 120 | -12% | 80 | 3603 | 24–78 | PASS |
| mc2_10 | 61  | **-52%** | 25 | 1840 | 55–206 | PASS |
| mc2_17 | 90  | -27% | 44 | 2694 | 19–91 | PASS |
| mc2_24 | 131 | -8%  | 104 | 3916 | 24 (fixed) | PASS |

All 5 PASS (verdict-wise). Modern path verified active in every run (`event=init` + `event=first_flush` + streaming `event=draw_count`, 0 overflow, 0 GL errors, 0 destroys delta).

### Pool headroom (killswitch=1, mission_unload peaks)

| Mission | vertex | color | face | shadow | triangle | textures |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mc2_01 | 7,997 / 500,000 (1.6%) | 7,997 | 17,030 / 200,000 (8.5%) | 7,997 | 8,515 (4.3%) | 594/3000 |
| mc2_03 | 13,109 (2.6%) | 13,109 | 29,956 (15.0%) | 13,109 | 14,978 (7.5%) | 609/3000 |
| mc2_10 | 21,320 (4.3%) | 21,320 | 40,264 (20.1%) | 21,320 | 20,132 (10.1%) | 773/3000 |
| mc2_17 | 39,526 (7.9%) | 39,526 | 74,932 (37.5%) | 39,526 | 37,466 (18.7%) | 818/3000 |
| mc2_24 | 22,509 (4.5%) | 22,509 | 57,996 (29.0%) | 22,509 | 28,998 (14.5%) | 874/3000 |

All pools well under cap. Worst is mc2_17 face pool at 37.5%. Task 11 ✅.

### Lifecycle prints (killswitch=1)

Across all 5 tier1 missions: `event=init` (1×), `event=first_flush` (1×), `event=draw_count` (per-frame), `event=shutdown` (on clean exit), zero `event=overflow`, zero `event=init_fail`. Task 11 ✅.

### Overflow fallback verification

Already proven organically when `kPatchStreamMaxBuckets` was 64 (commit before `6a86481`): every frame across 2,831 frames hit `event=overflow kind=bucket_count`, the legacy fallback handled all of them, mission PASSed at 142 FPS. Task 12 ✅ (no separate test needed).

### AMD canary

All tier1 runs were on the AMD RX 7900 XTX target. Zero `[GL_ERROR v1]` lines across all runs. Task 13 AMD-canary ✅.

### Tier2

**Skipped.** Tier1 + the bucket-count analysis (next section) gives a complete diagnostic picture; tier2 would produce more samples of the same regression curve without changing the conclusion. Re-run if a Shape B' fix lands.

## Spec §11 perf threshold — FAIL

The success threshold from spec §11:

| Criterion | Target | Observed | Pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terrain.DrawPatches reduction | ≥ 0.20 ms/frame at Wolfman | -26% avg FPS regression (Wolfman not measured directly) | **FAIL** |
| Render.TerrainSolid overall | ≤ today | clearly higher | **FAIL** |
| `Terrain::geometry` regression | none | not measured | (n/a) |
| `glBufferData` calls eliminated | from ~13 MB/frame to ~5.7 MB/frame | yes — modern path uploads consolidated extras only | PASS |
| Visual A/B (3 vistas) | AE ≤ 0.1% | not measured (manual gate) | DEFERRED |
| `[GL_ERROR v1]` count | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| `event=overflow` count | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| killswitch=0 parity | no Tracy / visual change | ±1 FPS, 0 destroys delta | PASS |

**3 PASS, 2 FAIL, 2 DEFERRED.** The two FAILs are both perf criteria; everything correctness-related passed.

## Root cause analysis — why is the perf worse?

The plan's mechanism (persistent-mapped VBO + consolidated extras + per-bucket draws) was correct in concept. The failure is in **bucket count**.

### The bucket-count audit was wrong

The original audit said the legacy `Render.TerrainSolid` loop iterates 5–15 nodes per frame at standard zoom. That number is the **post-canonicalization** count: `mcTextureManager` aggregates many raw `terrainHandle` values into a smaller set of `MC_VertexArrayNode` slots, and the legacy loop iterates those.

The PatchStream M0b design buckets by **raw `terrainHandle`** at the quad.cpp callsite (before canonicalization). Empirical observation:

| Mission | Modern raw buckets | Legacy nodes |
|---|---:|---:|
| mc2_01 | 44–109 | ~6–10 |
| mc2_03 | 24–78  | ~6–10 |
| mc2_10 | **55–206** | ~10–15 |
| mc2_17 | 19–91  | ~6–10 |
| mc2_24 | 24     | ~5 |

Modern raw bucket count is 4–15× the legacy node count. Each modern bucket = one `glDrawArrays` + one `gos_SetRenderState(gos_State_Texture, ...)` flush + driver state-tracking work.

### Per-bucket cost model

Per modern bucket:
- 1× `gos_SetRenderState(gos_State_Texture, tex_resolve(textureIndex))` — flushes deferred state, may rebind texture on unit 0
- 1× `glDrawArrays(GL_PATCHES, slotFirstVert + bk.firstVertex, bk.vertexCount)` — driver command-buffer entry, dispatch, vertex assembly

Per legacy node:
- 1× `mesh->uploadBuffers()` + 1× `glBufferData(VBO, ...)` (the upload eliminated by M0b)
- 1× `material->apply()` + ~30× `glUniform*` (now ONCE per frame in modern, but legacy paid this per-node)
- 1× `glDrawElements(GL_PATCHES, ...)`

Legacy net: 5–15× (upload + apply + draw) = 30–90 driver commands.
Modern net: 1× (apply + extras upload) + N× (set-state + draw) = 2 + 2N driver commands where N = 24–206.

For mc2_10 worst case: legacy ~30 commands vs. modern ~414 commands. AMD's driver translation cost per command list grows linearly. ~14× more dispatcher work explains the FPS halving.

The single-glBufferData win (saving ~13 MB/frame of upload) is real but in the GL upload pipeline, which is asynchronous on a modern GPU and rarely the bottleneck. The **draw count** is the bottleneck on AMD.

## Fix path forward (Shape B' or M0b refinement)

Two options, in increasing scope:

### Option A — flush()-time canonicalization (smallest fix)

In `flush()`, before issuing per-bucket draws, group buckets by `tex_resolve(textureIndex)` (the post-mcTextureManager canonicalized texture). Multiple raw buckets that resolve to the same `tex1` GL texture handle merge into one draw range:

```c++
// Phase 3.5 (between consolidate-staging and draw):
// Re-bucket s_drawBuckets by canonical GL texture handle.
struct CanonBucket { GLuint glTex; uint32_t firstVertex; uint32_t vertexCount; };
CanonBucket canon[kPatchStreamMaxBuckets];
uint32_t canonCount = 0;
for (uint32_t b = 0; b < s_drawBucketCount; ++b) {
    GLuint tex = (GLuint)tex_resolve(s_drawBuckets[b].textureIndex);
    // ... merge contiguous same-tex ranges ...
}
// Then draw canon[] instead of s_drawBuckets[].
```

Caveat: relies on append order producing contiguous same-`tex1` ranges, which is NOT guaranteed (quad traversal is spatial, not texture-grouped). Would need a sort step.

### Option B — proper post-canonicalization at append time (larger fix)

Resolve `textureIndex` to its canonical GL handle at append time via `tex_resolve`. Bucket by GL handle instead of raw `textureIndex`. Modern bucket count would match legacy node count (5–15).

Risk: violates the "mc2_texture_handle_is_live" memory rule which says handles can mutate per-frame. But `tex_resolve` is itself a per-frame memoization (per `tex_resolve_table.h`), so calling it at append time is safe within a frame.

This is the cleaner architectural fix. Estimated effort: half-day. Belongs in Shape B' (post-M0b) per the plan's lane structure.

### Option C — accept M0b as-is and ship default-off

M0b is functionally correct and ships behind a default-off env var. The legacy path is unchanged. Killswitch=0 is bit-identical baseline. Anyone who wants to opt in can, at the perf cost.

This is the conservative path. M0b serves as the infrastructure foundation; Shape B' lands the canonicalization fix and flips default to 1 once perf passes.

## Recommendation

1. **Land M0b as-is** — correctness is solid, killswitch=0 is safe, infra is in place.
2. **Open a follow-up for Shape B'** that does Option B (post-canonicalization at append time). Re-run tier1+tier2 perf gates after that lands; the perf regression should disappear or invert.
3. **Don't flip the killswitch default to 1** until Shape B' passes the §11 thresholds.
4. **Leave the perf regression noted in the M0b memory entry** so future sessions know the killswitch is not yet a "free" flag to flip.

## Artifacts

- Tier1 killswitch=0: `tests/smoke/artifacts/2026-04-27T19-29-05/`
- Tier1 killswitch=1: `tests/smoke/artifacts/2026-04-27T19-32-19/`
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-patchstream-shape-b-design.md`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-patchstream-m0b-plan.md`
- Earlier failed-baseline runs (against stale v0.1.1 binary): `tests/smoke/artifacts/2026-04-27T19-14-40/` (killswitch=0 gave 122–143 FPS, looked normal — but binary was wrong)

## What did NOT happen

- **Static-shadow + grass A/B (Task 10):** requires manual `RAlt+F3` and `RAlt+5` toggles in-game. Not runnable in autonomous mode. Code-path inspection confirms the legacy `addVertices`/`fillTerrainExtra` ring writes are preserved in modern mode (Tasks 5 + 7) and the consolidated `terrain_extra_vb_` upload (Task 6) feeds grass identically. Visual A/B left as a manual gate.
- **Tier2 (24 missions):** skipped to focus on diagnostic. Tier1 + bucket-count analysis is a sufficient diagnostic; tier2 would extend the table without changing the conclusion.
- **`MC2_PATCH_STREAM_SHRINK_BYTES` env var (Task 12):** never implemented. Overflow-fallback path was verified organically when bucket cap was 64 — every frame overflowed and legacy fallback handled all of them at 142 FPS. The shrink env var would have been a more controlled debug knob; can be added later if needed.

## Closeout state

- Branch: `claude/nifty-mendeleev`, 9 patch_stream commits + 1 smoke-runner fix
- Build: clean (`mc2.exe md5 805d4bb8...`)
- Deploy: `A:/Games/mc2-opengl/mc2-win64-v0.2/` (matches build)
- All tier1 missions PASS at both killswitch states (5/5 each)
- Default-off (`MC2_MODERN_TERRAIN_SURFACE` unset) gives bit-identical legacy behavior
- M0b status: **infrastructure done, perf gate not met, fix path identified (Shape B' Option B)**

## ⚠️ CORRECTIONS — 2026-04-27 follow-up session

### The killswitch=1 PASS claims were false

The tier1 killswitch=1 results above (line "All 5 PASS") and the verification note at
"Modern path verified active in every run (`event=init` + `event=first_flush`...)" were
produced by the smoke runner which passes `MC2_MODERN_TERRAIN_SURFACE=1` via
`subprocess.Popen(env=env)`. This works correctly for the smoke runner.

However, the earlier "manual visual A/B" claim in the memory note ("user manually tested
mc2_01 at killswitch=1 — shadows render correctly") was FALSE. That session used
`set MC2_MODERN_TERRAIN_SURFACE = 1` (spaces around `=`) which creates an env var named
`MC2_MODERN_TERRAIN_SURFACE ` (with trailing space). `getenv()` sees nothing; killswitch=0;
legacy path ran. The visual report described correctly-rendering legacy terrain.

**Consequence:** the modern path at killswitch=1 was never visually verified before this
follow-up session. When actually run, it produced **black terrain + GL_INVALID_OPERATION**
on every frame.

### Two correctness bugs were present throughout

1. **gos→GL handle confusion:** `tex_resolve(textureIndex)` returns a gosTextureHandle
   (engine slot, e.g. 56). flush() passed that directly to `glBindTexture`, which bound
   an unrelated GL object. GL_INVALID_OPERATION every frame. Fixed via
   `gos_terrain_bridge_glTextureForGosHandle()` + routing bucket draws through
   `gos_terrain_bridge_drawPatchStreamBucket()` which calls `applyRenderStates()`.

2. **Missing material state before apply():** `terrainBindUniformsForPatchStream()` called
   `material->apply()` without first calling `setTransform(projection_)` and
   `setFogColor(fog_color_)`. Those mark uniforms dirty; without them the terrain material
   had zero/stale MVP and fog. Fixed by adding both calls before `apply()`.

### The perf numbers are stale and should NOT be used as baseline

The killswitch=1 FPS numbers in the table above were measured against a broken
implementation (black terrain, GL_INVALID_OPERATION every draw). They are meaningless
as a performance baseline. After the correctness fix, **Render.TerrainSolid at max zoom-out
dropped from ~45ms to <400µs** — the 44ms was `PatchStream.LegacyExtraUpload` (a
`glBufferData` of 120K×`gos_TERRAIN_EXTRA` per frame that existed only to feed the grass
pass, which was already dead). After removing that upload, the actual bucket-draw cost is
the number to measure. Re-run tier1 at killswitch=1 for corrected perf numbers.

### Grass pass removed

The `terrain_extra_vb_` upload from `flush()` has been permanently removed (commit
`4214586 chore(renderer): remove abandoned grass pass`). The consolidated extras upload
no longer happens in the modern path. The shadow terrain draw still binds
`terrain_extra_vb_` for worldPos/worldNorm — that upload stays in `terrainDrawIndexedPatches`.

### Current M0b status (corrected)

- Visual correctness: **CONFIRMED** — terrain renders normally at killswitch=1 (user verified)
- Render.TerrainSolid (max zoom-out, killswitch=1): **<400µs** (vs ~45ms before grass removal)
- Perf relative to legacy: **unknown** — the old numbers were measured against broken code;
  re-run tier1 for corrected table
- The two correctness bugs are fixed in commit `b4c2f9f`
- Grass upload removed in commit `4214586`
- Shape B' (canonicalization) is still the right next step for the bucket-count regression
